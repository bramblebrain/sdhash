Based off of Ehplodor's hash calcuation, sdhash allows you to quickly get a list of model hashes and then saves it to hashes.txt file. Duplicate hashes will have their own column. This does not work for Hypernetwork or Embeds as the part that gets hashed appears to be the same.

You can either pass the model names as arguments or drag and drop the models on to the .bat (Windows). 

Duplicate hashes will be in a new row after the original with a **+** after the hash indicating that it's the duplicate row
